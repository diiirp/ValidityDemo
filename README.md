Validity Demo App

This is a Spring boot based web app using Spring MVC framework to display the data in the UI. The app can be build using the maven build tool. The pom.xml defines all the dependencies for the application.
The source file which is read is located in the resources folder.
For the demo of the app, run the app from eclipse with the embedded tomcat server. Once started, navigate to http://localhost:8080/getSortedData (or your server config) to the data grouped by unique and duplicate list.
